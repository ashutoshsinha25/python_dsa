# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms with Python repository! Here, you will find a collection of practice problems to enhance your understanding and proficiency in implementing various data structures and algorithms using the Python programming language.

# Contents
The repository is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. The current sections available are:

* Recursion
* Arrays and Lists
* Stacks and Queues
* Linked Lists
* Trees
* Graphs
* Sorting Algorithms
* Searching Algorithms
* Dynamic Programming
* and more

# How to Use
Each section contains a set of practice problems along with their corresponding solutions. You can explore the sections based on your interests or learning goals. To get started, simply navigate to the desired section and choose a problem that catches your attention.

For each problem, you will find a clear problem statement along with any additional instructions or constraints. Take your time to understand the problem and think about possible approaches before looking at the provided solution. Once you have implemented your solution, compare it with the provided solution to check for correctness and efficiency.

Feel free to experiment, modify the solutions, and come up with your own optimized versions. It's essential to understand the underlying concepts and analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.

# Contributions
This repository is open to contributions from the community. If you have a new problem or solution that you would like to share, we encourage you to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the established coding standards and include appropriate documentation.

# Learning Resources
If you are new to data structures and algorithms or need a refresher, here are some recommended resources to supplement your learning:

* "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser
* "Python Algorithms: Mastering Basic Algorithms in the Python Language" by Magnus Lie Hetland
* Online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer a wide range of practice problems with solutions.
